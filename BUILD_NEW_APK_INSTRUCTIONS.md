# Build New Android APK - Complete Instructions

## ✅ What I've Just Done

1. **Fixed the .env file** - Updated to correct Render URL:
   ```
   REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=https://baby-steps-demo-api.onrender.com
   ```

2. **Rebuilt React app** - Clean build completed successfully (19.93s)

3. **Verified build** - Confirmed Render URL is baked into the bundle

4. **Synced Capacitor** - Android assets updated with new build (0.573s)

## 🎯 Current Status

**Frontend Code**: ✅ Ready - All files updated and synced  
**Backend**: ✅ Live - Render deployment working perfectly  
**Android Build**: ⏳ Needs to be built

## 📱 Option 1: Build Using GitHub Actions (RECOMMENDED)

### Why This is Recommended:
- Automated build environment with Java pre-configured
- Consistent builds every time
- Easy to download signed APK
- No local setup required

### Steps:

1. **Check GitHub Actions Workflow**
   - Go to your GitHub repository
   - Navigate to `.github/workflows/android-build.yml`
   - Verify it exists

2. **Trigger the Build**
   - Go to your GitHub repo's "Actions" tab
   - Find "Android Build" workflow
   - Click "Run workflow"
   - Select your branch (usually `main`)
   - Click green "Run workflow" button

3. **Wait for Build** (Usually 10-15 minutes)
   - Watch the workflow progress in the Actions tab
   - Wait for green checkmark (success)

4. **Download APK**
   - Click on the successful workflow run
   - Scroll to "Artifacts" section at the bottom
   - Download `app-release.apk`
   - Unzip if needed

5. **Install on Android**
   - Transfer APK to your Android device
   - Enable "Install from Unknown Sources" in Settings
   - Open the APK file and install

## 📱 Option 2: Build Locally (IF YOU HAVE ANDROID STUDIO)

### Prerequisites:
- Android Studio installed
- Android SDK configured
- Java 17 or higher installed

### Steps:

1. **Open in Android Studio**
   ```bash
   # Open this directory in Android Studio:
   /app/frontend/android
   ```

2. **Build APK**
   - Click "Build" menu
   - Select "Build Bundle(s) / APK(s)"
   - Select "Build APK(s)"
   - Wait for build to complete

3. **Find APK**
   ```
   /app/frontend/android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk
   ```

4. **Install on Device**
   - Transfer to Android device
   - Install APK

## 🔧 Option 3: Manual Build via Command Line (ADVANCED)

If you have Java and Android SDK installed locally:

```bash
# Set up Java (adjust path for your system)
export JAVA_HOME=/path/to/java-17
export ANDROID_HOME=/path/to/android-sdk

# Navigate to Android directory
cd /app/frontend/android

# Clean and build
./gradlew clean
./gradlew assembleRelease

# Find APK at:
# app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk
```
