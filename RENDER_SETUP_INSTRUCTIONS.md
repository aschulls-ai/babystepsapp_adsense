# Complete Render PostgreSQL Setup Guide

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### STEP 1: Login to Render Dashboard

1. Go to: **https://dashboard.render.com**
2. Login with your account credentials

---

### STEP 2: Create PostgreSQL Database

1. **Click the blue "New +" button** (top right corner of dashboard)
2. **Select "PostgreSQL"** from the dropdown menu
3. **Fill in the database details**:
   - **Name**: `baby-steps-db` (or any name you prefer)
   - **Database**: `baby_steps_production` 
   - **User**: (leave auto-generated)
   - **Region**: **Choose the SAME region as your web service** (important for speed!)
     - If your web service is in Oregon, choose Oregon
     - If unsure, check your web service's region first
   - **PostgreSQL Version**: Latest (default is fine)
   - **Plan**: **Free** (select "Free" tier)
4. **Click "Create Database"** button at the bottom
5. **Wait 2-3 minutes** for the database to be provisioned
   - You'll see a status indicator - wait until it shows "Available"

---

### STEP 3: Copy the Database URL

Once the database is created and shows "Available":

1. You'll be on the database dashboard page
2. Scroll down to the **"Connections"** section (usually in the middle of the page)
3. You'll see several connection strings. Look for:
   - **"Internal Database URL"** ← **THIS IS THE ONE YOU NEED**
4. **Click the copy icon** next to "Internal Database URL"
   - It looks like: `postgres://baby_steps_db_user:xxxxx@dpg-xxxxx-a/baby_steps_db`
5. **Save this URL** - you'll need it in the next step

**Important**: Use "Internal Database URL" (not External) because your web service and database are on the same Render network.

---

### STEP 4: Configure Environment Variable in Web Service

1. **Go back to the main dashboard** (click "Dashboard" in top left)
2. **Find your web service**: `baby-steps-demo-api`
3. **Click on the service name** to open its dashboard
4. **Click "Environment"** in the left sidebar menu
5. **Click "Add Environment Variable"** button (or "Add Secret File" section)
6. **Add the new variable**:
   - **Key**: `DATABASE_URL`
   - **Value**: **Paste the Internal Database URL you copied in Step 3**
7. **Click "Save Changes"** button

**What happens next**: Render will automatically trigger a redeployment of your service (this is good!)

---

### STEP 5: Monitor the Deployment

After saving the environment variable:

1. You'll be automatically redirected to the **"Logs"** tab
2. Watch the logs as your service redeploys
3. **Look for these SUCCESS indicators** (scroll through the logs):
   ```
   ✅ Using PostgreSQL database (production)
   ✅ Database tables created/verified
   ✅ Demo data created successfully
   ```

4. **Watch for ERRORS** (if you see these, something is wrong):
   ```
   ❌ Error: connection to server failed
   ❌ Using SQLite database (development)  ← This means DATABASE_URL wasn't detected
   ```

5. **Wait for final message**:
   ```
   ==> Your service is live 🎉
   ```

**Deployment usually takes 3-5 minutes**

---

### STEP 6: Verify Everything is Working

Once deployment shows "Live":

1. **Check the service URL**: Should be `https://baby-steps-demo-api.onrender.com`
2. **Test the health endpoint** in your browser:
   - Open: `https://baby-steps-demo-api.onrender.com/api/health`
   - Should show: `{"status":"healthy"}`

---

## Quick Visual Checklist

- [ ] PostgreSQL database created and shows "Available"
- [ ] Copied "Internal Database URL" (starts with `postgres://`)
- [ ] Added `DATABASE_URL` environment variable to web service
- [ ] Service redeployed automatically
- [ ] Logs show "Using PostgreSQL database (production)"
- [ ] Logs show "Database tables created/verified"
- [ ] Health endpoint returns `{"status":"healthy"}`

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Can't find "New +" button
**Solution**: It's in the top right corner of the Render dashboard. If you don't see it, try refreshing the page or checking if you're logged in correctly.

### Issue 2: Database stuck on "Creating"
**Solution**: Wait a bit longer (up to 5 minutes). If it still doesn't change, try creating a new database with a different name.

### Issue 3: Logs show "Using SQLite database"
**Solution**: The DATABASE_URL environment variable wasn't detected. Double-check:
- You clicked "Save Changes" after adding the variable
- The variable name is exactly `DATABASE_URL` (case-sensitive)
- The value is the correct Internal Database URL

### Issue 4: Connection failed error
**Solution**: 
- Make sure you used "Internal Database URL" not "External Database URL"
- Make sure both database and web service are in the same region
- Check if the database shows "Available" status

### Issue 5: Service won't redeploy after adding variable
**Solution**: Manually trigger a deploy:
- Go to "Manual Deploy" tab in your web service
- Click "Deploy latest commit" button

## What to Do After Setup

Once everything shows green:

1. **Let me know deployment is complete** - I'll run comprehensive backend tests
2. **I'll verify all activity endpoints are working**:
   - `/api/activities` (GET and POST)
   - All 6 activity types: feeding, diaper, sleep, pumping, measurements, milestones
3. **Then we'll test from the frontend/Android app**
