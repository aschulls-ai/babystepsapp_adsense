# Track Activities Page Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Modal Dialog Size Issue ✅

**Problem:**
- Recording Milestones modal: Dropdown categories required scrolling to see all options
- Diaper Changes modal: Type dropdown was cut off and required scrolling

**Solution:**
- **File:** `/app/frontend/src/components/TrackingPage.js`
  - Changed modal `maxHeight` from `95vh` to `85vh` (line 2125)
  - Added `maxHeight: '60vh'` to form content area for better scrolling (line 2137)

- **File:** `/app/frontend/src/components/ui/select.jsx`
  - Increased SelectContent `max-h-60` to `max-h-96` (384px) (line 55)
  - Increased Viewport `max-h-[300px]` to `max-h-[400px]` (line 63)

**Result:**
- Dropdowns now display all options without requiring scrolling
- Modal dialogs are properly sized to fit content comfortably

### 2. Activity History Filtering Bug ✅

**Problem:**
- Milestones activities recorded but NOT showing when "Milestones" filter selected
- Growth (measurements) activities recorded but NOT showing when "Growth" filter selected
- Activities appeared in "All Activities" but disappeared when filtered

**Root Cause:**
The filter dropdown values didn't match the activity type values:
- Filter used: `"milestone"` and `"measurement"` (singular)
- Activity types saved: `"milestones"` and `"measurements"` (plural)

**Solution:**
- **File:** `/app/frontend/src/components/TrackingPage.js` (lines 710-711)
  - Changed `<SelectItem value="measurement">Growth</SelectItem>` 
  - To: `<SelectItem value="measurements">Growth</SelectItem>`
  - Changed `<SelectItem value="milestone">Milestones</SelectItem>`
  - To: `<SelectItem value="milestones">Milestones</SelectItem>`

**Result:**
- Milestones filter now correctly shows all milestone activities
- Growth filter now correctly shows all measurement activities
- Filter values match the actual activity types stored in database
