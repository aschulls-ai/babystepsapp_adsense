The trajectory details the AI engineer's work on the Baby Steps app, primarily focusing on fixing critical mobile build and connectivity issues. Initial efforts addressed frontend login UI discrepancies by correcting environment variable names ( to ) and API endpoint prefixes ( to ,  to ). This resolved core authentication and dashboard loading problems. Subsequently, the engineer tackled GitHub Actions build failures for iOS and Android. iOS build errors, related to Node.js version incompatibility and Capacitor dependencies, were fixed by upgrading Node.js to version 20 and adding  to . Android build issues, including signing key mismatches and version code conflicts, led to a complex keystore management saga, eventually simplified by recommending Google Play App Signing and updating version codes. The major recurring challenge was Android app connectivity to a remote server. After extensive debugging of network security, CORS, and Manifest settings, and despite confirming the Render server was healthy, a complete offline mode with local account creation and direct AI integration was planned as a backup. The current focus remains on resolving Android's persistent server connectivity.

<product_requirements>
The Baby Steps application aims to be a comprehensive parenting tool. Key features include baby tracking, nutrition/safety guidance, and user authentication. Recent development directives emphasized mobile conversion (Capacitor), Google AdSense monetization, a streamlined dashboard, full baby profile editing (including gender and profile picture), and detailed formula comparison. AI features for food research and meal planning require comprehensive, step-by-step information. The app also needs an interactive emergency training slideshow, persistent login, enhanced tracking with customizable quick actions and a robust reminder system, and a sortable activity log. User requests specifically included a Settings menu with light/dark mode, account information, and a rebalanced, professional Track Activities page. The application must be ready for native Vercel deployment and AdSense verification. The ongoing implementation has successfully addressed frontend login, session persistence, and initial Android/iOS build issues, and has an upcoming robust offline mode.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Full-stack Development**: React (frontend), FastAPI (backend), MongoDB (database).
-   **Mobile Development**: Capacitor for Android/iOS builds, GitHub Actions for CI/CD.
-   **Deployment**: Vercel (frontend and API routes), Render (public demo server).
-   **Authentication**: JWT-based.
-   **UI/UX**: Dark mode, responsive design.
-   **AI Integration**:  for research and meal planning.
-   **Android Specifics**: Network security policies, manifest permissions, version codes, Google Play App Signing, keystore management.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application utilizes a React frontend, a FastAPI backend, and a MongoDB database. For Vercel deployment, backend logic is increasingly shifted to serverless Node.js API routes within the  directory.



-   **/app/frontend/src/App.js**: Central for global state, auth, and routing. Modified to fix  to , update API prefixes for auth and babies endpoints, fix session persistence (correctly saving token, robust ), and integrate offline mode logic.
-   **/app/frontend/src/components/AuthPage.js**: Login/signup UI. Modified to reflect API prefix changes.
-   **/app/frontend/package.json**: Updated to add  and  for offline mode.
-   **/app/frontend/.env.production**:  corrected to .
-   **/app/frontend/android/app/build.gradle**: Updated  to  and configured  for release builds.
-   **/app/frontend/android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml**: Modified  to  and added aggressive network permissions.
-   **/app/frontend/android/app/src/main/res/xml/network_security_config.xml**: Simplified and made more permissive for  domain.
-   **/app/frontend/capacitor.config.json**: Configured for local build () instead of , and added debug settings.
-   **/app/frontend/src/offlineMode.js (new)**, **/app/frontend/src/offlineStorage.js (new)**, **/app/frontend/src/mockData.js (new)**: New files for implementing a comprehensive offline mode with local account creation and data management.
-   **/app/public-server/**: (New directory and files) Contains a minimal FastAPI demo server (, , , , , , , ) designed for public deployment on services like Render to act as a temporary backend.
-   **GitHub Workflows ()**:  fixed for Node.js 20, Capacitor dependencies, and caching.  modified to remove complex keystore generation, simplify for Google Play App Signing (using  with upload key), and auto-increment version codes. Temporary keystore-related workflows were created and then removed or simplified.

<pending_tasks>
-   **Complete Offline Mode Implementation**: Finish integrating the  with all features (AI components connecting to the internet as a backup).
-   **Network Connectivity Debugging**: Further investigate and resolve the persistent Android app connectivity issues to the backend server, beyond the currently applied fixes.
-   **Notification Permission Crash Rework**: Address the crash related to notifications properly, potentially by re-enabling them carefully or confirming the current disabling is robust.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was deep-diving into the persistent network connectivity issues affecting the Android app, despite the Render server being confirmed as live and functional. The user reported that DevTools were not working for diagnostics. As a primary countermeasure and backup, the engineer initiated the implementation of a comprehensive offline mode that allows users to create accounts and use most app functionalities locally, with AI components designed to connect directly to the internet. This was a direct response to the user's explicit request to have a backup for server connectivity. Concurrently, the engineer also began investigating a new critical bug: the Android app crashes upon granting notification permissions. The focus shifted to addressing both issues, with initial steps taken to analyze and modify Android Manifest and network security configurations for better connectivity and to disable notification-related features to prevent crashes.

<optional_next_step>
Complete the integration of the comprehensive offline mode for the Android app, ensuring all functionalities, especially AI components, work as intended.
