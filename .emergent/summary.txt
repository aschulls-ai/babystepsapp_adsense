The AI engineer's work in this trajectory involved an extensive series of feature enhancements, bug fixes, and infrastructure improvements for the Baby Steps application. Initial tasks included updating the privacy policy, adding a desktop version link, and implementing user profile editing with necessary backend and frontend changes, resolving authentication token mismatches. Significant effort was dedicated to fixing pervasive dark mode styling issues across numerous UI components, ensuring text and background visibility.

Further development included updating dashboard quick actions, implementing scroll-to-top navigation for key pages, and enhancing the feed reminder with hours, minutes, and a real-time countdown. Major challenges arose from mobile build processes, where iOS and Android build errors in GitHub Actions were systematically addressed, culminating in a successful setup for consistent Android AAB signing. A new ad removal feature was implemented using Google Play Billing, but an attempt to integrate native AdMob led to critical app crashes due to version incompatibility with Capacitor. The AdMob integration was reverted, and the trajectory concludes with the AI engineer researching alternative AdMob integration strategies and re-evaluating compatibility claims.

<pending_tasks>
-   Investigate user's claim regarding  v7.x compatibility with Capacitor 7.x, as it contradicts previous troubleshooting findings.
-   Based on the investigation, decide whether to re-attempt AdMob integration (if compatible) or explore alternative ad solutions, or proceed with a Capacitor downgrade (if deemed necessary and feasible).

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary request, the AI engineer was working on integrating native AdMob into the Android application. This involved installing the Capacitor AdMob plugin, adding AdMob IDs and SDK dependencies, and updating  and  components. However, this integration caused severe app crashes due to an incompatibility between the  plugin (v7.0.3) and the current Capacitor version (7.4.3).

Following a troubleshooting session, the AdMob plugin and all related code (AdMobService, AdMob-specific manifest/gradle entries, adUnitKeys in components) were removed to restore app functionality to a stable state, reverting to web-only AdSense. The user then inquired about the impact of downgrading Capacitor to version 6.x to potentially re-enable a compatible native AdMob. The engineer generated a  document outlining the breaking changes. The current work concludes with the engineer actively researching a user's new claim that AdMob v7.x might actually be compatible with Capacitor 7.x, directly challenging the previous incompatibility finding.
