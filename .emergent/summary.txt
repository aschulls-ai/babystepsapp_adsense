The previous AI engineer's work centered on enhancing the Baby Steps application's AI features by transitioning from external LLMs to a robust, local JSON-based knowledge base. Initial efforts focused on refining Meal Planner responses and establishing a comprehensive knowledge base for all AI functionalities (Meal Planner, AI Assistant, Food Research). Key technical tasks included implementing semantic matching, handling specific data formats (e.g., 10-recipe arrays), and ensuring strict JSON-only responses for Food Research. Challenges involved resolving Android/iOS build issues via GitHub Actions, and addressing user feedback regarding generic AI responses. Significant progress was made on an intelligent auto-suggestion system for search bars. The most recent and primary task involved extending the JSON-only model to the AI Assistant, enabling it to query multiple knowledge bases ( and ). This required extensive backend () modifications, including refining the matching algorithms to prevent false positives and correctly combine relevant information. The work concluded with downloading updated knowledge base files from the user.

The Baby Steps mobile application is a comprehensive parenting tool for Android/iOS, providing baby tracking, nutrition/safety guidance, and user authentication. Initial features included AdSense, a streamlined dashboard, baby profile editing, formula comparison, AI-powered food research and meal planning (with step-by-step instructions), an emergency training slideshow, persistent login, enhanced activity tracking with quick actions/reminders, and a sortable activity log. A crucial evolving requirement was a robust standalone offline mode for local account and data management. For AI features, the app initially connected to the internet for Copilot-quality search results from Bing/Google, presented concisely and age-specific. Recently, a local JSON-based knowledge base with curated answers was introduced, featuring a 10-recipe array for Meal Planner and strict JSON-only responses for Food Research. An auto-suggestion system for search bars was also implemented. The current focus is on transitioning the AI Assistant to a JSON-only, multi-knowledge-base model.

<code_architecture>
The application uses a React frontend, FastAPI backend, and MongoDB, with Capacitor for mobile deployment.



-   **frontend/src/aiService.js**: Manages core AI interactions. It was modified to integrate  for semantic matching and handle JSON-only responses, specifically for food research and meal plans.
-   **frontend/src/knowledgeBase.js**: (New file) Handles loading, caching, and searching local JSON knowledge base files. It supports diverse JSON formats and semantic similarity.
-   **frontend/public/knowledge-base/**: (New directory and files) Stores static JSON knowledge base files (, , ). These files were created, populated, and most recently, updated by the user.
-   **frontend/src/components/Research.js**: AI Assistant interface. It was updated to integrate  and uses  which in turn calls .
-   **backend/server.py**: FastAPI backend.
    -   The  endpoint was modified to exclusively use the local JSON knowledge base, bypassing external AI, with a refined matching algorithm.
    -   The  endpoint (AI Assistant) was modified to implement a JSON-only mode, querying *both*  and . The matching algorithm, including keyword scoring and thresholds, was extensively refined to improve precision and prevent false positives, specifically to correctly combine food safety information with general parenting advice.
-   **test_result.md**: Documentation for testing. It was consistently updated to track task progress, report testing outcomes (backend and frontend), and communicate issues/fixes.

- Further UI/UX polish: Ensure no menu overlap and titles are consistent across pages (beyond dark mode fixes).
- Investigate and resolve potential Android UI display issues for Food Research results, as reported by the user (Chat 449).
- Address the UI display issue for Question ID attribution (not visible to users).

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer successfully transitioned the AI Assistant functionality to a JSON-only, multi-knowledge-base mode. This involved modifying the  endpoint in  to draw answers from both  (general parenting) and  (food safety). The implementation included refining the semantic matching algorithm for both the AI Assistant and the dedicated Food Research endpoint () to ensure higher precision, eliminate false positives, and correctly combine relevant information.

Initial backend testing showed 85% success, highlighting a need for a stricter matching algorithm. This was addressed by refining keyword scoring and adjusting confidence thresholds in  for both AI Assistant and Food Research, leading to 94.4% overall success in subsequent backend tests, with perfect unrelated topic filtering and strong combined query support.

Frontend testing, however, revealed specific issues: incorrect Food Research results (strawberry queries returning honey info), AI Assistant not consistently combining food safety queries from , and UI display issues with Question ID attribution. The AI engineer focused on fixing the matching algorithms in  for both  and  to resolve the data inaccuracies. These backend fixes were successfully validated by a third round of backend testing, achieving 100% success for critical fixes. The user's last action was to upload the updated , , and  files, which the AI engineer downloaded.
