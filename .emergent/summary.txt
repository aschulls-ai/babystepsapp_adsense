The previous AI engineerâ€™s work has largely focused on stabilizing and enhancing the Baby Steps mobile application. Initially, efforts were directed at resolving critical build issues for iOS and Android, and later, network connectivity problems to the backend, leading to a crucial pivot: implementing a comprehensive standalone offline mode. This offline mode included local account creation, data storage, and direct AI integration. Subsequent work involved fixing numerous bugs related to baby profile saving, activity tracking (e.g.,  context issues in ), and refining the AI service. The AI integration strategy evolved significantly, moving from a backend proxy to direct client-side internet searches (Bing/Google) to emulate Copilot-style professional responses. UI/UX issues, such as menu overlaps and incorrect button navigation, were also addressed. The work concluded with iterative fixes to improve the quality, formatting, and relevance of AI search results, particularly for the Meal Planner and Food Research features, based on detailed user feedback.

<product_requirements>
The Baby Steps mobile application aims to be a comprehensive parenting tool via Capacitor for Android/iOS. Key features include baby tracking, nutrition/safety guidance, and user authentication. Initial requirements covered Google AdSense monetization, a streamlined dashboard, full baby profile editing (gender, picture), formula comparison, AI-powered food research and meal planning (with step-by-step info), an emergency training slideshow, persistent login, enhanced activity tracking with quick actions and reminders, a sortable activity log, and a settings menu (light/dark mode, account info). A critical evolving requirement was a robust standalone offline mode, enabling local account creation and data saving for all tracking activities. For AI features, the app must connect directly to the internet, providing Copilot-quality search results from Bing/Google, especially when backend connectivity is an issue, and present these concisely, specific to the baby's age.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Full-stack**: React, FastAPI, MongoDB.
- **Mobile**: Capacitor (Android/iOS), GitHub Actions (CI/CD).
- **Deployment**: Vercel (frontend), Render (public-server).
- **Authentication**: JWT, local storage (offline).
- **AI Integration**:  (initially), direct client-side web scraping/search (Bing/Google) for standalone app.
- **Offline Mode**: , .
- **Android Specifics**: Network security, manifest permissions.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application consists of a React frontend, a FastAPI backend, and MongoDB. It supports both cloud deployment (Vercel/Render) and a standalone mobile application.



-   **frontend/src/App.js**: Central for global state, auth, and routing. Modified for standalone/offline mode, session persistence, and connecting to  or external backend.
-   **frontend/src/offlineMode.js**: Manages local data storage, authentication, and offline data manipulation for the standalone app. Critical for data persistence. Many  context issues were fixed here.
-   **frontend/src/aiService.js**: Handles AI calls. Refactored multiple times: initially for , then to use backend AI endpoints, and finally to perform direct client-side web searches (Bing/Google) with detailed result extraction and formatting.
-   **frontend/src/components/AuthPage.js**: Login/signup UI. Updated for offline mode logic and error handling (try-catch blocks).
-   **frontend/src/components/Dashboard.js**: Displays baby information. Modified to handle initial Add Baby button navigation to baby profile.
-   **frontend/src/components/FoodResearch.js, MealPlanner.js, Research.js**: AI-powered components. Updated to use the evolved  for web searches and to display results with proper layout and formatting. MealPlanner title and content were fixed.
-   **frontend/src/components/TrackingPage.js**: Activity tracking. Forms (, , etc.) updated to use  instead of  for local saving. Activity history sorting fixed (changed  to ). Added error handling to Sleep/Milestone forms.
-   **frontend/src/services/MobileService.js**: Mobile-specific services. Push notification token sending and sync functions were disabled for standalone mode to prevent external API calls and 422 errors.
-   **frontend/android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml & network_security_config.xml**: Android specific configurations for network permissions.
-   **public-server/app.py**: FastAPI backend (for Render). Integrated  for AI but later the frontend bypassed it for standalone mode.

<pending_tasks>
- **Refine Meal Planner Search Results**: Ensure meal planner results are recipe-focused and provide detailed preparation instructions, matching Bing's quality.
- **Further UI/UX polish**: Ensure no menu overlap and titles are consistent across pages. (Partially addressed, but continuous refinement implied).
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing user feedback regarding the **Meal Planner search results**. The user reported that the results were generic and requested actual recipe examples with detailed preparation instructions, similar to Bing's output, and that the age of the baby should be incorporated into the search query (e.g., when can my 9 month old baby have honey). The engineer had previously implemented a system to perform real web searches via the device's internet for AI features (Food Safety, Meal Planner, AI Assistant) and to format these as Bing-style clean answers, simplifying queries to just user input plus baby age. The engineer identified that the current meal planner results, though from web searches, were still too basic. The last action was an edit to  to enhance the  function to provide detailed, recipe-focused results and then initiate a build and sync of the application.

<optional_next_step>
Build and sync the application, then test the meal planner results to ensure they are recipe-focused as requested.
