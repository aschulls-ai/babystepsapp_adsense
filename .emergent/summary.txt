The previous AI engineer's work primarily focused on migrating the Baby Steps app's AI features from local JSON to OpenAI's API. This involved refining semantic matching, consolidating , , and  into a single  component, and updating backend endpoints ( to ). A significant part of the trajectory involved meticulously debugging Android connectivity issues caused by environment variable overrides, offline mode defaults, Axios adapter incompatibilities, and a critical authentication flow flaw (standalone login instead of backend). Concurrently, the AI addressed Android app signing certificate mismatches in GitHub workflows and worked on deploying a production backend to Render, which ultimately failed due to dependency issues and a Pydantic validation error in the AI endpoint, indicating an API structure mismatch.

The Baby Steps mobile application (Android/iOS) is a parenting tool providing tracking, nutrition/safety guidance, and authentication. The core problem was to enhance and centralize its AI capabilities. Initially using local JSON knowledge bases, the requirement evolved to consolidate all AI functionalities (Food Research, Meal Planning, AI Assistant) into a unified AI Parenting Assistant page. This assistant must operate exclusively via an external OpenAI API (preferably  for cost-effectiveness), entirely replacing local data dependencies, while maintaining a user-friendly interface. Key challenges involved resolving OpenAI API key permissions, addressing Android-specific network and authentication issues, and ensuring seamless deployment to a scalable production backend like Render.
