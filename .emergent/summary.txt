The previous AI engineer's work primarily focused on migrating the Baby Steps app to a production environment on Render with PostgreSQL. This involved extensive debugging of Android app connectivity (environment variables, offline mode, Axios adapters, authentication flow), addressing app signing certificate mismatches in GitHub workflows, and resolving numerous backend deployment issues on Render. Key challenges included fixing Pydantic validation errors, configuring CORS, correctly installing , migrating from ephemeral SQLite to persistent PostgreSQL, and refactoring database interactions using SQLAlchemy. Recent efforts focused on fixing an Android app crash attributed to  double initialization, network calls during startup, and finally, a persistent user login issue where the backend reported user not found despite frontend indications of existing accounts, coupled with AI assistant functionality not sending requests.

The Baby Steps mobile application (Android/iOS) is a parenting tool providing tracking, nutrition/safety guidance, and user authentication. The core problem was to enhance and centralize its AI capabilities, migrating from local JSON to an external OpenAI API (preferably ) via . This required consolidating all AI functionalities into a unified AI Parenting Assistant. Critical requirements included resolving OpenAI API key permissions, addressing Android-specific network and authentication issues, ensuring persistent data storage by migrating from SQLite to PostgreSQL, and deploying seamlessly to a scalable production backend (Render). The user expects the Android app to open without crashing, allow registration, login, baby profile creation, and functional AI responses.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Full-stack**: React (frontend), FastAPI (backend), PostgreSQL (database, migrated from SQLite).
-   **Mobile**: Capacitor (Android/iOS) for hybrid app development.
-   **AI Integration**: OpenAI Chat API (), Emergent Integrations.
-   **Deployment**: GitHub Actions (CI/CD), Render (production hosting).
-   **Authentication**: JWT tokens, password hashing (bcrypt).
-   **Networking**: CORS, , environment variables for URLs.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>

-   **frontend/src/App.js**: Main entry. Replaced Axios with , improved global state and authentication flow, refined error handling in initialization to prevent crashes, and updated login response parsing.
-   **frontend/src/services/MobileService.js**: Fixed a critical double initialization bug by removing the  call from the constructor to prevent Capacitor plugin crashes.
-   **frontend/android/app/src/main/res/xml/network_security_config.xml**: Modified to allow  and included domains like , ,  to prevent Android security from blocking external scripts and causing app crashes.
-   **frontend/capacitor.config.json**: Updated  block to  for the Render backend URL and wildcard,  to .
-   **frontend/.env.env.production.env.local**: Consistently updated to . These files were frequently a source of issues due to incorrect URLs.
-   **public-server/app.py**: Production FastAPI backend.
    -   Integrated  for PostgreSQL, replacing SQLite and enabling proper password hashing (bcrypt) in auth endpoints.
    -   Fixed  parameter definitions in root and login endpoints.
    -   CORS configuration adjusted from  with  to  for mobile WebView compatibility.
    -   AI chat endpoint () confirmed to use  and .
    -   Baby profile endpoints were updated to use the new SQLAlchemy ORM.
    -   Minor adjustments to food research and meal search return formats.
-   **public-server/database.py**: New module created for SQLAlchemy ORM and PostgreSQL integration. Defines User, Baby, Activity models and handles database connection, initialization, and demo data creation, abstracting away SQLite for production.

-   **.github/workflows/android-build.yml**: Configured to use the Render production URL for  during build. Addressed keystore generation logic, with current strategy relying on user to manually uninstall old APKs due to certificate mismatches.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
-   Investigate why the AI Assistant page is not sending requests to the backend from the Android app.
-   Resolve the user login issue where the user registers successfully but logs show user not found for that email. This might be a frontend/local storage state issue or a subtle backend persistence problem.
-   Further address and stabilize any intermittent backend 502 Bad Gateway errors observed during testing, which suggest service instability or temporary network issues.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the focus was on resolving critical user-reported issues on the Android app. The app now opens, registration and baby profile creation appear successful, but AI assistant searches fail (no backend logs for AI requests) and, after logging out, re-login fails with invalid credentials.
-   User provided server logs showing  attempts login, but the backend reports User not found in database.
-   The user confirmed they had registered with  and even tried re-registering, which resulted in an account with this email already exists message from the frontend.
-   This discrepancy indicates a mismatch between the frontend's perceived state and the backend's actual database records, strongly suggesting a frontend local storage/cache issue.
-   The AI engineer has advised the user to clear the app's data and cache on their Android device, or to try registering with a different email, to rule out local data corruption or stale state.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
Assist the user in troubleshooting the persistent login failure and AI assistant request issue after they clear app data and retest.
