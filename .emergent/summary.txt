The previous AI engineerâ€™s work has focused on incrementally improving the Baby Steps mobile application. Initially, efforts refined the Meal Planner's AI responses for detailed recipes. A significant architectural shift involved implementing a comprehensive JSON-based knowledge base for all AI features (Meal Planner, AI Assistant, Food Research), moving away from direct web searches or external LLMs for improved control and offline capability. This required extensive modifications across the frontend (, , UI components) and backend () for semantic matching and fallback logic.

Key challenges included resolving Android and iOS build/versioning issues, particularly with GitHub Actions overriding settings, and addressing user feedback about generic or incorrect Food Research results. This led to making the Food Research engine strictly JSON-only, completely bypassing external AI. A major UX improvement, an intelligent auto-suggestion system for search bars, was also successfully implemented and tested. The project is currently transitioning the AI Assistant to a JSON-only, multi-knowledge-base model.

The Baby Steps mobile application aims to be a comprehensive parenting tool for Android/iOS via Capacitor. Key features include baby tracking, nutrition/safety guidance, and user authentication. Initial requirements covered Google AdSense monetization, a streamlined dashboard, full baby profile editing, formula comparison, AI-powered food research and meal planning (with step-by-step info), an emergency training slideshow, persistent login, enhanced activity tracking with quick actions and reminders, a sortable activity log, and a settings menu. A critical evolving requirement was a robust standalone offline mode, enabling local account creation and data saving for all tracking activities. For AI features, the app must connect directly to the internet, providing Copilot-quality search results from Bing/Google, and present these concisely, specific to the baby's age. Recently, a local JSON-based knowledge base with preset, curated answers was introduced, including a 10-recipe array format for Meal Planner and strict, JSON-only responses for Food Research. An auto-suggestion feature for search bars was also implemented.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Full-stack**: React, FastAPI, MongoDB.
- **Mobile**: Capacitor (Android/iOS), GitHub Actions (CI/CD).
- **Offline Mode**: , UUIDs, local JSON knowledge base.
- **AI Integration**: Evolved from external LLMs/web search to local JSON knowledge base with semantic matching.
- **Build Tools**: Craco, Gradle, Xcode.
- **Frontend State**: React , .

<code_architecture>
The application consists of a React frontend, a FastAPI backend, and MongoDB, supporting mobile via Capacitor.



-   **frontend/src/aiService.js**: Core AI interaction logic. **Modified extensively** to integrate the , implement semantic matching, handle specific formatting for meal plans (10-recipe array), and manage strict JSON-only responses for food research. Hardcoded AI responses were removed.
-   **frontend/src/knowledgeBase.js**: (New file) Manages loading, caching, and searching local JSON knowledge base files. **Created and updated** to support diverse JSON formats, age range parsing, and semantic similarity matching with configurable thresholds.
-   **frontend/public/knowledge-base/**: (New directory and files) Stores static JSON knowledge base files (, , ) for curated Q&A. **Created and populated** with placeholder structures and confirmed for mobile builds.
-   **frontend/src/components/MealPlanner.js**: Displays meal plans. **Updated** to use  and display results, specifically the 10-recipe array format. Dark mode visibility was also addressed.
-   **frontend/src/components/FoodResearch.js**: Food research interface. **Updated** to use  and integrate the  component. Dark mode visibility fixed.
-   **frontend/src/components/Research.js**: AI Assistant interface. **Updated** to use  and integrate . Dark mode visibility fixed.
-   **frontend/src/components/QuestionSuggestions.js**: (New file) Provides auto-suggestions for search inputs. **Created** to offer keyword-based matching for relevant questions in a dropdown, enhancing UX.
-   **frontend/src/components/TrackingPage.js**: Activity tracking. **Modified** to disable a problematic sleep form submit button that caused screen blanking; the quick actions sleep button was reactivated.
-   **frontend/src/components/admin/KnowledgeBaseAdmin.js**: (New file) A placeholder admin component for the knowledge base. **Created** but not fully implemented.
-   **frontend/android/app/build.gradle**: Android build config. **Modified** to manage  and  for Google Play.
-   **frontend/ios/ExportOptions.plist**: (New file) iOS export options. **Created** for development provisioning.
-   **frontend/ios/App/App.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj**: iOS project file. **Modified** for version numbers.
-   **frontend/capacitor.config.json**: Capacitor config. **Modified** to include iOS-specific standalone settings ().
-   **frontend/ios/App/App/Info.plist**: iOS Info.plist. **Modified** for permissions and network configuration in standalone mode.
-   **backend/server.py**: FastAPI backend. **Modified** the  endpoint to use **only** the local JSON knowledge base, bypassing external AI, with a refined matching algorithm.
-   **.github/workflows/android-build.yml & ios-build.yml**: GitHub Actions CI/CD. **Modified** to auto-increment Android/iOS version numbers and improve error handling for iOS builds.
-   **test_result.md**: Testing documentation. **Updated** to track task progress and communicate with testing agents.

<pending_tasks>
- Further UI/UX polish: Ensure no menu overlap and titles are consistent across pages (beyond dark mode fixes).
- Investigate and resolve potential Android UI display issues for Food Research results, as reported by the user (Chat 449).

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was tasked with transitioning the **AI Assistant** functionality to a **JSON-only knowledge base mode** and enabling it to draw answers from *both* the  (general parenting) and  (food safety) files for more comprehensive responses. This follows the successful implementation and testing of a similar JSON-only mode for the **Food Research** engine, which now strictly provides food safety information from its curated JSON file, completely bypassing external AI/web searches. The engineer had also recently addressed Android/iOS versioning inconsistencies, fixed GitHub Actions CI/CD overrides for version numbers (implementing an auto-incrementing system), resolved dark mode visibility issues across several components, and successfully implemented an intelligent auto-suggestion system for search bars in both Food Research and AI Assistant. The current task initiated by the user is a logical extension of the knowledge base integration. The AI's last action was to begin identifying the relevant backend endpoint in  to implement this JSON-only, multi-knowledge-base functionality for the AI Assistant.
