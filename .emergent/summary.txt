The AI engineer's trajectory chronicles a comprehensive development cycle for the Baby Steps application. Initially, it involved addressing critical feature enhancements like user profile editing, privacy policy updates, and dark mode styling fixes across numerous UI components, including the , , , , , and . Significant effort was dedicated to CI/CD stability, specifically resolving iOS build issues and establishing robust Android AAB signing. A major feature, ad removal via Google Play Billing, was implemented successfully. However, a native AdMob integration attempt led to severe app crashes due to Capacitor version incompatibility, prompting its full reversion and subsequent research into compatibility. The trajectory then pivoted to fixing several UI/UX bugs in the  and  components related to modal sizing, activity filtering, and dark mode readability. A Vercel-optimized demo version with auto-login was created for AdSense review, encountering and resolving several build and routing issues. Finally, the focus shifted to Google Play Console declarations, where the AI engineer provided a privacy policy URL, detailed data safety guidance, and attempted to create a Robo script for pre-launch reports, ultimately concluding that Robo scripts are unsuitable for Capacitor web apps and suggesting alternative login credential submissions. The current work is focused on creating a data deletion request page.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing the user's need for app declarations for Google Play Console submission. The AI engineer had provided the Privacy Policy URL (), Terms of Service URL (), and a comprehensive guide for filling out the **Data Safety** section, detailing collected data types (personal info, health, photos, child data, app activity), security practices (encryption in transit, data deletion requests), and data sharing with Google AdSense.

The user then explicitly asked for a link that users can use to request their account and data is deleted. The AI engineer confirmed understanding and stated, Let me create a dedicated data deletion request page for your app. The last action was the intention to create this new page.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
