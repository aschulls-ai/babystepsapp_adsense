## FINAL RECOMMENDATION

### ‚ùå DO NOT DOWNGRADE

**Reasons:**
1. **High risk, low immediate benefit** - App has 0 revenue currently
2. **12-22 hours of work** - Better spent on user acquisition
3. **AdSense works** - May work in WebView, testing needed first
4. **Plugin will update** - @capacitor-community/admob will get v8 for Capacitor 7
5. **React 19 risk** - Potential incompatibility with Capacitor 6
6. **Stability matters** - Working app > slightly better ads
7. **Opportunity cost** - Could build 2-3 new features instead

### ‚úÖ RECOMMENDED ACTION PLAN

**Phase 1: Current (Week 1-2)**
- ‚úÖ Keep Capacitor 7.4.3
- ‚úÖ Use AdSense in WebView
- ‚úÖ Test if AdSense shows in Android app
- ‚úÖ Focus on user acquisition
- ‚úÖ Build ad removal purchase flow

**Phase 2: When Revenue Matters (Month 2-3)**
- Monitor AdMob plugin updates
- Research alternative plugins
- A/B test ad placement for maximum revenue
- Optimize ad removal pricing

**Phase 3: If Revenue Justifies (Month 4+)**
- Re-evaluate downgrade if:
  - App has 1000+ daily users
  - Ad revenue > $100/month
  - Plugin still not updated
  - Alternative solutions don't exist
