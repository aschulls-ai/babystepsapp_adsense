# Data Deletion Request Feature - Deployment Notes

## Feature Summary
Created a comprehensive data deletion request page that allows users to request account and data deletion for Google Play Console compliance.

## What Was Implemented

### Frontend
1. **DataDeletionRequest.js** - New page at `/data-deletion`
   - Detailed information about what will be deleted
   - Warning that action cannot be undone
   - 30-day processing time notice
   - Alternative options section
   - Form with email validation and optional reason field
   - Success confirmation screen
   - Dark mode compatible
   - Link added to Settings page

2. **App.js** - Added route for `/data-deletion`

3. **Settings.js** - Added "Request Data Deletion" link in Legal & Support section

### Backend
1. **Local Backend** (`/app/backend/server.py`) - MongoDB
   - POST `/api/deletion-request` endpoint ✅ WORKING
   - Stores requests in `deletion_requests` collection

2. **Production Backend** (`/app/public-server/app.py`) - PostgreSQL
   - POST `/api/deletion-request` endpoint ✅ CODE READY
   - Stores requests in `deletion_requests` table
   - **⚠️ NEEDS DEPLOYMENT TO RENDER**

### Database Schema
**DeletionRequest Model:**
- `id` - Unique identifier
- `email` - User's email address
- `reason` - Optional reason for deletion
- `status` - Request status (pending/processing/completed)
- `created_at` - Timestamp
- `processed_at` - Timestamp (nullable)

## Testing Results

### ✅ Local Backend (Port 8001)
- Endpoint working correctly
- Successfully stores deletion requests in MongoDB
- Returns proper JSON response with success message and request_id

### ✅ Frontend UI
- Page renders correctly at `/data-deletion`
- Link visible in Settings page with red border styling
- Form validation working
- Dark mode styling correct

### ⚠️ Production Backend (Render)
- Code is ready in `/app/public-server/app.py`
- Database model added to `database.py`
- **ACTION REQUIRED**: Deploy to Render

## Deployment Steps for Render

1. **Update Database Schema**
   ```bash
   # The DeletionRequest model will be automatically created when the app starts
   # If using migrations, ensure the migration includes:
   # - deletion_requests table
   # - All required columns (id, email, reason, status, created_at, processed_at)
   ```

2. **Deploy to Render**
   - Push latest code to the GitHub repository connected to Render
   - Or trigger manual deployment in Render dashboard
   - Verify `/api/deletion-request` endpoint is accessible

3. **Verify Deployment**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST "https://baby-steps-demo-api.onrender.com/api/deletion-request" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"email": "test@example.com", "reason": "Testing"}'
   ```

## URLs for Google Play Console

### Data Deletion Request URL
`https://babystepsapp.app/data-deletion`

### Data Safety Declaration
This page provides users with a way to request deletion of their account and all associated data, meeting the requirements for:
- GDPR (Right to be forgotten)
- CCPA (Right to deletion)
- Google Play Data Safety requirements
- Apple App Store privacy requirements

## What Data Gets Deleted
As documented on the deletion request page:
1. User Account (email, name, credentials)
2. Baby Profiles (names, birth dates, photos)
3. Activity Data (feeding, sleep, diaper changes)
4. Measurements & Milestones
5. AI Conversations
6. Settings & Preferences

## Admin Dashboard Notes
Deletion requests are stored with `status: "pending"` for admin review. You may want to:
1. Create an admin interface to view/process deletion requests
2. Set up automated email confirmations
3. Implement automated deletion after 30 days
4. Add logging for GDPR compliance
