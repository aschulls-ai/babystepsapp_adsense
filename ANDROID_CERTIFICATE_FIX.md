# CRITICAL: Android APK Installation Failure - Certificate Mismatch

## üö® ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED

**The app won't install because of CERTIFICATE MISMATCH!**

### Why This Happens

Each GitHub Actions build generates a **NEW signing certificate**. Android security prevents installing an APK with a different certificate over an existing installation.

**Timeline**:
1. You installed Baby Steps v1.0.X (with certificate A)
2. We made backend changes
3. New builds generated (v1.0116, v1.0118, v1.0119) with certificate B, C, D
4. Android blocks installation: "App not installed"

### üéØ IMMEDIATE FIX

**You MUST uninstall the old app first!**

#### On Your Android Device:

1. **Long press** the Baby Steps app icon
2. Select **"App info"** or **"Uninstall"**
3. Click **"Uninstall"**
4. Confirm removal
5. **Then** install the new APK

OR

1. Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **Apps**
2. Find **"Baby Steps"** or **"Baby Steps Mobile"**
3. Click **"Uninstall"**
4. Confirm
5. **Then** install the new APK

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Data Loss Warning

**Uninstalling will delete**:
- All locally stored baby data
- Saved preferences
- Authentication tokens

**Data will be preserved if**:
- You're using backend sync (Render)
- You have an account and babies are stored on the server

### üîê Long-Term Solution

To prevent this issue in future builds:

**Option 1: Use Consistent Keystore** (Recommended)

1. Generate ONE keystore:
```bash
keytool -genkeypair -v \
  -keystore baby-steps-release.keystore \
  -alias babysteps \
  -keyalg RSA \
  -keysize 2048 \
  -validity 10000
```

2. Save to GitHub Secrets:
   - Go to: Repository ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Secrets ‚Üí Actions
   - Add: `ANDROID_KEYSTORE_BASE64` (base64 encoded keystore)
   - Add: `KEYSTORE_PASSWORD`, `KEY_ALIAS`, `KEY_PASSWORD`

3. Workflow will use this keystore for all builds

**Option 2: Use Google Play App Signing**

If publishing to Google Play:
- Google manages the signing certificate
- You only sign uploads
- Users can update without certificate issues

### üì± Installation Steps (After Uninstall)

**Via ADB** (if device is connected to computer):
```bash
adb uninstall com.babysteps.mobile
adb install /path/to/new.apk
```

**Via File Manager**:
1. Download new APK to device
2. Open "Files" or "Downloads"
3. Tap the APK file
4. Allow "Install unknown apps" if prompted
5. Click "Install"

### üîç How to Verify

After uninstall and reinstall:

1. App should install without error
2. App icon appears on home screen
3. Tapping icon opens the app
4. Login screen or dashboard appears (no crash)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Why This Only Happened After Render

**It's not Render's fault!** The certificate issue was always present but hidden:

**Before Render**:
- You were probably testing with debug builds (same certificate)
- Or you were uninstalling between tests

**After Render**:
- You started using release builds from GitHub Actions
- Each build had a different certificate
- Android detected the mismatch and blocked installation

### üìä Certificate Comparison

Check certificate fingerprints:

**Old APK**:
```bash
unzip -p old.apk META-INF/*.RSA | keytool -printcert
```

**New APK**:
```bash
unzip -p new.apk META-INF/*.RSA | keytool -printcert
```

If SHA fingerprints differ ‚Üí certificate mismatch ‚Üí must uninstall

### üéØ Action Required

1. ‚úÖ **Uninstall** Baby Steps from Android device
2. ‚úÖ **Download** latest APK (v1.0119 or newer)
3. ‚úÖ **Install** the new APK
4. ‚úÖ **Test** - app should open successfully!

The backend changes (Render) are working perfectly. The installation issue is purely about Android security and certificate management.
