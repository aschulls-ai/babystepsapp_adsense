# 🔢 Google Play Console Version Fix

## 🔍 Issue Analysis

**Error**: "You can't rollout this release because it doesn't allow any existing users to upgrade to the newly added app bundles."

**Root Cause**: The uploaded AAB had `versionCode 1`, which is not higher than the existing version in Google Play Console.

## ✅ Solution Applied

### 1. **Updated Static Version Code**
```gradle
// Before (causing conflict)
versionCode 1
versionName "1.0.0"

// After (compatible with Play Console)
versionCode 26
versionName "1.0.26"
```

### 2. **Implemented Auto-Incrementing Version Code**
The Android build workflow now automatically increments the version code:

```yaml
# Auto-increment version code based on GitHub run number
NEW_VERSION_CODE=$((25 + ${{ github.run_number }}))
```

**Formula**: `Version Code = 25 + GitHub Run Number`

- **Run #1**: Version Code 26
- **Run #2**: Version Code 27  
- **Run #3**: Version Code 28
- **And so on...**

## 🚀 Expected Results

### Next Android Build Will Have:
- ✅ **Version Code**: 26 or higher (auto-incremented)
- ✅ **Version Name**: "1.0.26" or higher
- ✅ **Google Play Compatible**: Higher than existing versions
- ✅ **Automatic Upgrades**: Users can upgrade from previous versions

### Google Play Console:
- ✅ **Upload Success**: No version conflict errors
- ✅ **Rollout Enabled**: Can proceed with internal testing/production
- ✅ **User Upgrades**: Existing users can upgrade to new version

## 📱 Version Management

### Current Configuration:
- **Base Version Code**: 25 (starting point)
- **Auto-increment**: +1 per build
- **Version Name Format**: "1.0.X" where X matches version code

### Future Builds:
Each Android build will automatically get a unique, incrementing version code, preventing Google Play Console conflicts.

## 🔄 Next Steps

1. **Run Android Build Workflow**:
   - Version code will be automatically set to 26+
   - AAB will be compatible with Google Play Console

2. **Upload to Google Play**:
   - Download the new AAB artifact
   - Upload to Play Console (should succeed without errors)

3. **Proceed with Release**:
   - Internal testing should work without version conflicts
   - Users can upgrade from previous versions

**🎯 Result**: Google Play Console version conflicts are now resolved with automatic version management!
