# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false

##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

CRITICAL FINDINGS: 1) AUTHENTICATION: ✅ Demo user login (demo@babysteps.com/demo123) working perfectly with JWT token authentication 2) ENDPOINT FUNCTIONALITY: ✅ /api/meals/search endpoint responding correctly and providing detailed responses (3,365 characters average) 3) CURRENT IMPLEMENTATION ANALYSIS: ✅ System provides comprehensive AI-generated responses with multiple recipe ideas ✅ Responses include detailed ingredients, instructions, safety guidelines, and age-appropriate modifications ✅ Random selection working (2/3 unique responses in multiple searches) ✅ Recipe format completeness verified (4/6 elements present) ✅ Variety tips included in responses 4) MISSING 10-RECIPE FORMAT FEATURES: ❌ No evidence of pre-defined 10-recipe knowledge base ❌ No 'Recipe X of 10 available options' variety indicators ❌ No structured array format with 10 different recipes ❌ No random selection from fixed set of 10 recipes 5) WHAT'S ACTUALLY IMPLEMENTED: The system uses AI (GPT-5 via emergentintegrations) to generate comprehensive, detailed recipe responses dynamically rather than selecting from a pre-defined set of 10 recipes. While this provides excellent, detailed responses, it does NOT match the specific 10-recipe format described in the review request. 6) TEST RESULTS: 5/8 tests passed, 3/8 failed due to missing 10-recipe format implementation. CONCLUSION: The meal planner provides excellent detailed recipe content but the specific 10-recipe format with random selection from a knowledge base has NOT been implemented. The current AI-based approach works well but differs from the requested specification."

The login form submission is not triggering any network requests, indicating a disconnect between the frontend authentication logic and the backend configuration. 4) TESTING LIMITATIONS: Cannot test complete user journey (baby profile management, activity tracking, AI features, data persistence) because users cannot log in. All other UI components appear functional but are inaccessible due to authentication barrier.

OUTSTANDING RESULTS: 85.7% success rate (12/14 tests passed). PRECISION IMPROVEMENTS CONFIRMED: ✓ Unrelated topics (100% success) - smartphone training, car recommendations, college prep, investment advice all correctly return 'Information Not Available' ✓ Valid parenting questions (67% success) - feeding and sleep questions correctly match ai_assistant.json ✓ Food safety questions (100% success) - honey, eggs, strawberries all correctly match food_research.json ✓ Combined questions (100% success) - multi-knowledge-base support working perfectly ✓ Edge cases (50% success) - most edge cases handled correctly. ALGORITHM STRENGTHS: Excellent exclusion of unrelated topics, accurate food safety detection, perfect multi-KB support, stricter parenting context requirements working. MINOR REFINEMENT NEEDED: One edge case ('What baby food can I eat while dieting?') incorrectly matches parenting KB instead of returning 'not available' - algorithm occasionally matches adult-focused questions with baby context. CONCLUSION: The refined matching algorithm demonstrates significant precision improvements and successfully prevents false positives for the vast majority of test cases. The algorithm meets the review requirements for stricter context requirements, higher scoring thresholds, and better exclusion of unrelated topics."

(NOT honey) ✅ 'Is avocado safe for babies?' → Returns avocado-specific answer with safety guidance (NOT honey) ✅ 'Can babies eat strawberries?' → Returns strawberry-specific answer with caution level (NOT honey) ✅ 'Are peanuts safe for babies?' → Returns peanut-specific answer with introduction guidance (NOT honey) ✅ 'Is honey safe for babies?' → Returns honey-specific answer with avoid safety level (correctly honey) 3) KNOWLEDGE BASE FIX SUCCESS: ✅ Each food query returns information specific to that food ✅ NO MORE defaulting to honey responses for non-honey queries ✅ Knowledge base properly matches food names to correct entries ✅ Responses are clean without source attribution 4) USER ISSUE RESOLVED: The user's reported issue where food safety research was 'still prioritizing honey' instead of giving results for the specific food asked about has been completely fixed. All hardcoded food responses that were bypassing the knowledge base system have been successfully removed. CONCLUSION: The food research knowledge base fix is working perfectly with 100% success rate (5/5 tests passed). Users now get food-specific information for each query instead of defaulting to honey responses."

OUTSTANDING RESULTS: 1) AUTHENTICATION VERIFICATION: ✅ Demo user login (demo@babysteps.com/demo123) working perfectly with JWT token authentication 2) CRITICAL TEST CASES FROM REVIEW REQUEST - ALL PASSED (3/3): ✅ 'Can babies eat pizza?' → Correctly returns 'Food Safety Information Not Available' message (NO false positive to eggs) ✅ 'When can babies eat eggs?' → Returns JSON ID 202 with egg-specific information only ✅ 'Is honey safe for babies?' → Returns JSON ID 201 with honey-specific content and botulism warning 3) ALGORITHM REFINEMENTS VERIFIED: ✅ Requires food name presence: Must find actual food keywords in both query and JSON entry ✅ Higher food match scores: Food name matches now worth 50 points instead of 30 ✅ Increased threshold: Minimum score raised from 30 to 50 points ✅ Conditional safety scoring: Safety keywords only count if food name found 4) FALSE POSITIVE FIX CONFIRMED: ✅ Pizza query does NOT return egg-specific information (previous issue fixed) ✅ Pizza query correctly shows 'Food Safety Information Not Available' ✅ Available foods list properly displayed (Honey, Eggs, Nuts/Peanuts, Strawberries) ✅ Sources correctly show 'Knowledge Base - No entry found' for pizza 5) JSON-ONLY IMPLEMENTATION VERIFIED: ✅ All responses come from JSON knowledge base with Question IDs ✅ No AI/LLM calls for food research queries ✅ Source attribution working: 'Knowledge Base Question ID: XXX' ✅ Proper safety levels: eggs=caution, honey=avoid, pizza=consult_doctor 6) COMPREHENSIVE BACKEND TESTING: ✅ All major backend functionality tested and working (authentication, baby profiles, activity tracking, AI endpoints) ✅ Database connectivity confirmed ✅ Error handling appropriate ✅ CORS configuration working CONCLUSION: The refined JSON-only food research matching algorithm is working perfectly. The false positive issue where 'pizza' was incorrectly matching to 'eggs' has been completely resolved. All critical test cases pass with 100% success rate. The system now requires actual food name matches and prevents false positives while maintaining correct matches for foods in the JSON database."

MIXED RESULTS FOUND: 1) IMPLEMENTATION STATUS: ✅ JSON-only implementation IS present in backend code (lines 1139-1261) ✅ Code loads JSON knowledge base from /app/frontend/public/knowledge-base/food_research.json ✅ Smart matching algorithm implemented with keyword scoring ✅ Source attribution with 'Knowledge Base Question ID: XXX' working ✅ 'Not available' responses implemented for unknown foods 2) SUCCESSFUL TEST CASES (4/5 passed): ✅ 'When can babies eat eggs?' → Returns JSON ID 202 with eggs-specific content ✅ 'Can babies eat strawberries?' → Returns JSON ID 205 with strawberries-specific content ✅ 'Is honey safe for babies?' → Returns JSON ID 201 with honey-specific content and 'avoid' safety level ✅ 'Is avocado safe for babies?' → Correctly returns 'Food Safety Information Not Available' with food list 3) CRITICAL ISSUE IDENTIFIED (1/5 failed): ❌ 'Can babies eat pizza?' incorrectly matches to eggs (ID 202) instead of returning 'not available' ❌ Matching algorithm too aggressive - gives 30+ points for common words like 'can', 'babies', 'eat' ❌ No food-specific keyword match required, allowing false positives 4) BACKEND LOGS ANALYSIS: ⚠️ Still shows some LiteLLM API calls, indicating other endpoints may still use AI ✅ Food research endpoint itself appears to use JSON-only approach ✅ Authentication working perfectly with demo@babysteps.com/demo123 5) CORE FUNCTIONALITY ASSESSMENT: ✅ JSON knowledge base loading: WORKING ✅ Question ID attribution: WORKING ✅ Food-specific responses: MOSTLY WORKING ✅ 'Not available' responses: WORKING ❌ Matching algorithm precision: NEEDS REFINEMENT CONCLUSION: The JSON-only implementation is 80% functional. Core system works correctly for most queries, but matching algorithm needs fine-tuning to prevent false positives like pizza→eggs matching. The system successfully eliminated AI responses for most food queries and provides proper JSON-based answers with source attribution."

        -comment: "❌ CRITICAL: JSON-ONLY FOOD RESEARCH NOT IMPLEMENTED: Conducted comprehensive testing of the new JSON-ONLY food safety research implementation as requested in urgent review. CRITICAL FINDINGS: 1) CURRENT IMPLEMENTATION STATUS: ❌ Backend still using AI (LlmChat with emergentintegrations GPT-5) instead of JSON-only responses ❌ Food research endpoint (/api/food/research) returns AI-generated responses, not JSON database answers ❌ No evidence of JSON knowledge base integration in backend code 2) JSON KNOWLEDGE BASE VERIFICATION: ✅ JSON knowledge base exists at /app/frontend/public/knowledge-base/food_research.json ✅ Contains correct question IDs: ID 201 (honey - 12+ months, botulism), ID 202 (eggs - 6 months, cook thoroughly), ID 205 (strawberries) ✅ JSON structure is correct with designated question IDs as specified 3) CRITICAL TEST FAILURES: ❌ 'When can babies eat eggs?' still returns AI response mentioning honey (should return JSON ID 202 about eggs only) ❌ 'Can babies eat pizza?' returns AI-generated pizza answer (should return 'not available' message) ❌ Complex queries get AI responses (should return 'not available' for non-JSON foods) ❌ No 'Knowledge Base Question ID: XXX' source attribution found ❌ Still has honey defaulting issue for non-honey queries 4) BACKEND LOGS CONFIRMATION: ✅ Backend logs show LiteLLM GPT-5 API calls for all food research queries ✅ No JSON file reading or knowledge base matching detected ✅ All responses generated by AI, not pulled from JSON database 5) TEST RESULTS: 3/8 tests passed, 5/8 failed. SUCCESS CRITERIA NOT MET: Each food query should return ONLY corresponding JSON answer, source should show 'Knowledge Base Question ID: XXX', no AI/web search responses, no honey defaulting for non-honey queries, clear 'not available' message for foods not in JSON database. CONCLUSION: The JSON-ONLY food safety research implementation described in the review request has NOT been implemented. The backend is still using the previous AI-based approach. The complete rewrite to pull answers ONLY from JSON file with designated question IDs needs to be implemented."

Despite standalone mode being initialized, the login process attempts backend API calls instead of using offlineAPI.login(). The babysteps_current_user is not being set in localStorage, preventing access to protected routes. CRITICAL ISSUE: Standalone authentication must be fixed before activity tracking data persistence can be tested. The core functionality exists but is inaccessible due to authentication blocking."
