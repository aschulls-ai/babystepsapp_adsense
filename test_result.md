# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"

##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

While this provides excellent, detailed responses, it does NOT match the specific 10-recipe format described in the review request. 6) TEST RESULTS: 5/8 tests passed, 3/8 failed due to missing 10-recipe format implementation.

Migration script at /app/public-server/migrate_database.py will safely add 12 missing columns using 'ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS' syntax.

OUTSTANDING RESULTS: 85.7% success rate (12/14 tests passed). PRECISION IMPROVEMENTS CONFIRMED: ‚úì Unrelated topics (100% success) - smartphone training, car recommendations, college prep, investment advice all correctly return 'Information Not Available' ‚úì Valid parenting questions (67% success) - feeding and sleep questions correctly match ai_assistant.json ‚úì Food safety questions (100% success) - honey, eggs, strawberries all correctly match food_research.json ‚úì Combined questions (100% success) - multi-knowledge-base support working perfectly ‚úì Edge cases (50% success) - most edge cases handled correctly. ALGORITHM STRENGTHS: Excellent exclusion of unrelated topics, accurate food safety detection, perfect multi-KB support, stricter parenting context requirements working. MINOR REFINEMENT NEEDED: One edge case ('What baby food can I eat while dieting?') incorrectly matches parenting KB instead of returning 'not available' - algorithm occasionally matches adult-focused questions with baby context. CONCLUSION: The refined matching algorithm demonstrates significant precision improvements and successfully prevents false positives for the vast majority of test cases. The algorithm meets the review requirements for stricter context requirements, higher scoring thresholds, and better exclusion of unrelated topics."
