# Backend URL Fix - Complete Resolution

## 🎯 Issue Resolution Summary

**Problem**: Android app crashing on startup with "Baby Steps keeps stopping" error due to hardcoded old backend URL.

**Root Cause**: The app was built with the old preview URL (`https://openai-parent.preview.emergentagent.com`) instead of the new Render production URL (`https://baby-steps-demo-api.onrender.com`).

## ✅ Files Updated

### 1. Frontend Environment Files
- **`/app/frontend/.env`** ✅
  ```env
  REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=https://baby-steps-demo-api.onrender.com
  ```

### 2. Vercel Configuration
- **`/app/frontend/vercel.json`** ✅
  - Updated API proxy destination from old preview URL to Render production URL

## 🔨 Build Process Completed

### Step 1: Environment Fix ✅
- Updated `.env` file with correct Render URL
- Verified no old URLs remain in environment files

### Step 2: React Build ✅
```bash
cd /app/frontend && yarn build
```
- Build completed successfully (17.88s)
- Build output verified: `build/static/js/main.f04d2509.js`
- Confirmed new URL present in build: `baby-steps-demo-api.onrender.com`
- Confirmed old URL **NOT** present in build

### Step 3: Capacitor Sync ✅
```bash
npx cap sync android
```
- Web assets copied to Android app
- Capacitor config updated in Android assets
- 9 Capacitor plugins synced successfully
- Sync completed in 0.262s

## 📱 Android App Status

### Current State
✅ **Backend URL Updated**: All environment files now point to Render  
✅ **Build Completed**: React app rebuilt with correct URL  
✅ **Capacitor Synced**: Android app updated with new build  
✅ **Ready for Testing**: App can now be tested locally or rebuilt for distribution

### Files Verified
- **Source Code**: ✅ No hardcoded old URLs found
- **Build Output**: ✅ Contains only new Render URL
- **Android Assets**: ✅ Updated via Capacitor sync
- **Network Config**: ✅ Allows `onrender.com` domain

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Option 1: Local Testing (Immediate)
```bash
cd /app/frontend/android
./gradlew installDebug
```
This will build and install a debug APK on a connected Android device.

### Option 2: Release Build (For Distribution)
```bash
cd /app/frontend/android
./gradlew assembleRelease
```
The signed APK will be at:
```
android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk
```

### Option 3: GitHub Actions (Automated)
The `.github/workflows/android-build.yml` workflow is already configured with the correct Render URL:
- Environment variables set to Render production URL
- Workflow will use the updated `.env` file
- APK artifacts will be ready for download after build completes

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

After installing the updated APK:

- [ ] **App Opens**: Should launch without "keeps stopping" error
- [ ] **Login Works**: Can authenticate with `demo@babysteps.com` / `demo123`
- [ ] **Dashboard Loads**: Shows baby profile (Emma Johnson)
- [ ] **AI Features Work**: Can ask questions in AI Assistant
- [ ] **Network Logs**: Should show connections to `baby-steps-demo-api.onrender.com`

## 🔍 Verification Commands

### Check if old URL exists anywhere:
```bash
grep -r "openai-parent.preview.emergentagent.com" /app/frontend/ 2>/dev/null
# Should return: NO MATCHES
```

### Check if new URL is in build:
```bash
grep -r "baby-steps-demo-api.onrender.com" /app/frontend/build/ 2>/dev/null
# Should return: MATCHES in build files
```

### Verify Android assets:
```bash
grep -r "baby-steps-demo-api.onrender.com" /app/frontend/android/app/src/main/assets/ 2>/dev/null
# Should return: MATCHES in Capacitor config
```
